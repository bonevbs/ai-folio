Welcome! I am a ML/AI Engineer at NVIDIA working on Machine Learning and Numerical Algorithms. The prospect of applying mathematics, algorithms and physics to tackle the great challenges facing us today is what gets me out of bed everyday.

I earned my [Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics](/files/thesis_compressed.pdf) from [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch) under the supervision of [Prof. Jan S. Hesthaven](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/mcss/members/hesthaven/). Prior to that, I have obtained degrees in both Physics and in Aerospace Engineering. My [academic research](/research) focuses on computational methods for scientific applications. Check out [publications](/publications) and [software](/software) for more.

In the past, I have been fortunate to work, collaborate and learn from some truly awesome people. These include: [Anima Anandkumar](https://www.eas.caltech.edu/people/anima), [Maximilian Baust](https://mbaust.github.io), [Frank Giraldo](https://frankgiraldo.wixsite.com/mysite), [Mahya Hajihassanpour](https://mahyahhp.github.io/projects/), [Jan S. Hesthaven](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/mcss/members/hesthaven/), [Christian Hundt](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=jcoDb5gAAAAJ), [Karthik Kashinath](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sNMCgVwAAAAJ&hl=en), [Michal Kopera](https://www.boisestate.edu/computing/directory/faculty-directory-2/michal-kopera/), [Thorsten Kurth](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dGa1CFkAAAAJ&hl=en), [Jaideep Pathak](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cevw0gkAAAAJ&hl=en), [Lukas Prantl](https://ge.in.tum.de/about/lukas-prantl/), [Nils Thuerey](https://ge.in.tum.de/about/n-thuerey/)
